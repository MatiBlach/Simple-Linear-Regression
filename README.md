# Simple Linear Regression

This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression** model to predict the **Miles Per Gallon (MPG)** of a vehicle based on its **Weight**. The code demonstrates two methods of fitting the regression line: 

1. **Closed-form Solution (Normal Equation)**
2. **Batch Gradient Descent**

Both methods aim to find the optimal parameters (`theta_0` and `theta_1`) that minimize the prediction error.

## Methodology

1. **Closed-form Solution**:
   - The closed-form solution is implemented using the normal equation:
     \[
     \theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
     \]
     where `X` is the matrix of features, and `y` is the target variable (`MPG`).
   - The regression line is then plotted on the test data, and the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is computed to evaluate the model's performance.

2. **Batch Gradient Descent**:
   - A batch gradient descent algorithm is used to iteratively update the parameters `theta_0` and `theta_1` using the gradient of the MSE with respect to the parameters.
   - The parameters are updated over several iterations, and the final model is evaluated using the test data.
   
3. **Standardization**:
   - Both the features (`Weight`) and target variable (`MPG`) are standardized before applying gradient descent. This is done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
   
## Results

- After calculating the optimal parameters using both methods, the **MSE** on the test set is compared.
- The regression lines generated by both methods are plotted to visualize the model's performance.

## Requirements
- **NumPy** for matrix operations and gradient descent.
- **Matplotlib** for plotting the regression line and data points.
